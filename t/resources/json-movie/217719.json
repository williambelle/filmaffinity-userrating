   "synopsis" : "After a paragliding accident, Philippe, a rich aristocrat, is confined to his home. He employs Driss as home help. Driss is a young guy from the projects recently out of prison. In short, the person the least adapted for the job. Vivaldi and Earth, Wind and Fire, fine language and slang, suits and jogging outfits come together and a clash is inevitable. Two worlds collide and win each other over to give birth to a friendship as crazy, funny, and fierce as it is unexpected. A unique relationship that will make sparks fly and render Philippe and Driss untouchable.",
